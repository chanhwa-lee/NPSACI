# NPCI

- The code in this repository implements the nonparametric sample splitting estimators developed in the paper "**Efficient Nonparametric Estimation of Stochastic Policy Effects with Clustered Interference**"
 
- The estimator utilizes ensemble estimator of the nuisance functions via SuperLearner in R

## Summary

The GitHub repository comprises two folders: `~/simulation` and `~/application`, which store reproducible codes for all computational work in the manuscript.

In the `~/simulation` folder, reproducible codes for simulation results in the main text and the supplementary materials are stored. Running the shell scripts `~/simulation/CIPS/estimand_main.sh` and `~/simulation/CIPS/estimator_main.sh` computes causal estimands under the CIPS policy and their proposed estimates. The main code implementing the proposed method is found in the `estimand.R`, `estimator.R`, and `Helpfunc.R` files in the same directory. The simulation results are summarized by `readresult.R`. The simulation study for the TPB policy is done similarly, and the codes and results are in `~/simulation/TPB`. Additional simulation code and results in supplementary materials are available in `~/simulation/additional_simulation`.

In the `~/application` folder, code for real data analysis is stored. 
Senegal Demographic Health Survey (DHS) provides sociodemographic, enviromental, and health-related information on household members. 
In the survey, households were randomly sampled from census blocks. 
The survey data was used to assess the effect of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities on diarrhea incidence among children in Senegal.
Senegal DHS WASH data is publicly available upon request at [https://dhsprogram.com/data/available-datasets.cfm](https://dhsprogram.com/data/available-datasets.cfm).
Place the Senegal DHS WASH data (described below) at `~/application/Data`, 
and run `~/application/Data/Preprocessing.R` to get cleaned data for the analysis. 
Run the `~/application/CIPS/estimator_main.sh` shell scripts to get estimates of Senegal DHS WASH causal estimands under the CIPS policy. The main code is in `estimator.R` in the same directory. The estimation results are summarized and visualized by `Visualization.R`. Estimation results for the TPB policy are done similarly, and the codes and results are in `~/application/TPB`.

## :file_folder: application

Analysis on the effect of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities on diarrhea among children in Senegal accounting for the clustered interference.

### :file_folder: Data

#### Senegal DHS data [(ANSD and ICF, 2020)](https://www.dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR368/FR368.pdf)
- Sociodemographic, enviromental, and health-related survey on household members
